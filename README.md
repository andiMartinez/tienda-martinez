## Arquitectura

The application has a dynamic NavBar component where the categories to be selected are mapped. The NavBar is outside the scope of Routes since it renders the same way on any screen. It also includes the container components that include the logic of the states and/or promises in order to display the list of products in the body of the home (ItemListConteiner-> ItemList -> Item) and also ItemDetailContainer -> ItemDetail.The cartWidget is a component that is displayed on the NavBar and maps the /Cart path.

## This store is made with react CRA, Node and TailwindCSS, with a mock api for products.
